    <h1><b>Discoveries</b> Activity 4</h1>
      <p><b>What are the available image file formats?</b><br>Available image file formats include PNG, JPEG, GIF and SVG</p>
      <p><b>What are the artistic filters that you have applied?</b><br>I added a filter called duotone and changed the parameters of the filter to get the achieved effect.</p>
      <p><b>What is meant by color balance?</b><br>Color balance can add or remove colors from photos as well as change the intensity of certain colors.</p>
      <p><b>What are Hue and Saturation?</b><br>Hue changes the range of colors in an image whereas saturation can make colors more vibrant or muted. </p>
      <p><b>Who owns this file after the considerable changes you have made to the images?</b><br>The original uploader or person who took/created the image/photo.</p>
      <p><b>What is meant by ownership, pixels, binary representation</b><br>Ownership defines who has commercial rights over specific content.<br>Pixels are the the smallest element in a display or image. It is only 1 color and many pixel are used to create a single image.<br>Binary representation is the binary form of a file type. Binary representations consists solely of 1's and 0's</p>

      <h1><b>Activity 1</b></h1>

        <p><b>Examples of machine learning and deep learning. </b> An example of machine learning can be a spam detector that learns when users reports emails as spams and over time marks emails as spam with greater. An example of deep learning can be computer vision and object detection where a machine learning model known as a neural networks is used</p>

      <h1><b>Activity 2</b></h1>

        <p><b>What is depth-first search? </b>Depth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching a tree or graph data structure. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.</p>
        <p><b>Advantage: </b>DFS has a memory advantage over Breadth-First Search because it only needs to store the nodes along a single branch of the tree or graph at any given time.</p>
        <p><b>Disadvantage: </b>DFS may not find the shortest path to a node, making it less efficient than BFS in certain situations.</p>

        <p><b>My understanding: </b>ChatGPT has a large collection of the data, when a question it analyzes the keywords and topic points and uses those to query the databases for information that it needs to construct a response</p>
